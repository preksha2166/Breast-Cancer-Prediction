# Breast Cancer Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting breast cancer using machine learning techniques. The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook, where we explore the dataset, preprocess the data, and build a predictive model to classify breast cancer cases.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains features extracted from breast cancer cases. These features are numerical representations derived from medical examinations and measurements.

### Key Features:
- Mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.
- Diagnosis label: Malignant (M) or Benign (B).

## Objectives
1. Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, normalize data, and encode labels.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data.
3. Build a machine learning model to classify breast cancer cases.
4. Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using relevant metrics.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (>= 3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-prediction.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd breast-cancer-prediction
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb
```
2. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, visualize results, and train the model.

## Machine Learning Pipeline
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Normalize features for better model performance.
   - Encode categorical labels into numerical format.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Visualize feature distributions and correlations.
   - Identify trends and anomalies in the data.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Use supervised learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machine (SVM).
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal results.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Analyze the confusion matrix for insights into classification performance.

## Results
- The trained model achieves a high accuracy in classifying breast cancer cases.
- Insights from EDA support the validity of key features in predicting outcomes.
